# CraterFinancials.com - Test Automation Framework - UI & API
Sample end 2 end test automation framework for UI and API testing


This sample Software Test Automation Framework is built as a Maven project using Behavior Driven Development principles with Cucumber and Junit in Java. Page Object Model structure is also utilized to maximize the framework re-usability and maintainability. 

And the UI test scenarios are written in Gherkin language that could benefit connecting the team.

And also this framework is structured to support API test automation using RestAssured library. 


## Project Structure

src/test/java
 - api_tests - where API tests resides (API tests written using RestAssured library in TestNG test structure)
 - pages - Page objects are collected/created and defined in this folder
 - runners - one or more test runner classes are created within this folder
 - step_definitions - Test step implementation for the cucumber scenario steps defined in this folder
 - utils - Any utility and support classes and functions for testing activities are in this folder
 
src/test/resources
 - features - Cucumber feature files are created in this folder to define the user scenarios for the app features
 - test_files - Any test data files that are used for testing purposes are stored in this folder
 - testdata - Any test data or properties files are stored in this folder
 
Cucumber_reports - Cucumber report files generated by the cucumber are stored in this folder

pom.xml - pom.xml is used to define the project configurations, libraries/content/dependencies management and build/execution configurations.


## Tools used 

 Maven - is used to define the project configurations, libraries/content/dependencies management and build/execution configurations, and used for both UI and API.

 UI - tools used for UI test automation:
 
  - Cucumber - is used to define feature scenarios in gherkin, and also to create test suites and execution flow by tagging, and also reporting
  - Junit - is used to run the cucumber scenarios with cucumber options, and assertion.
  - Selenium WebDriver - is used to automate web application by implementing the cucumber step definitions, and managing the page objects
  - Faker - is used to provide fake test data for the tests
  
 API - tools used for API test automation:
  
   - TestNG - is used to manage the API test cases, test suites and test execution flow and Assertion, and reporting. 
   - RestAssured - is used to define the API tests in a very simple and readable manner
   - Faker - is used to provide fake test data for the tests
   
 Other tools used to achieve end 2 end test flow:
   
   - GIT - is used to manage source code and version control
   - Github - is used as a remote source code management platform and version control tool
   - Jenkins - is CI/CD tool which we have used to run the test suites remotely. 
   - Eclipse - IDE for the project development
